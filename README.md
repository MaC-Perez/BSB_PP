## Black Sea Bass CPUE standardization 

## Survey Design 

The information was collected from nearly identical surveys in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The areas are randomly stratified by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) statistical area and by depth strata (0-20 m; 21-40 m). 

*For Massachusetts, strata included two zones in Buzzards Bay and one zone in Massachusetts Bay with 12 stations at each zone. 
*Rhode Island surveys run from June to August, with seven stations for Narragansett Bay, 8 in Block Island Sound and 9 in Rhode Island Sound.  

Stations were monitored using a six-trap trawl with three vented traps and three ventless traps intercalated every 18.3 meters. Each station was sampled twice per month from June through September 2007-2015 and once from 2015 to 2020 (?) during August. Massachusetts did not conduct surveys during 2013 due to a lack of funding. Soak time averaged three to five days. All traps are baited, with the bait type changing based on availability and price. Recorded information includes count of sea bass, lengths since 2015, age, and bottom type. 

## Data files

The data used for the CPUE standardization was unified in a single base (MA_BB_RI_TRAWL.csv) including the trawl information for the 3 zones (Massachusetts Bay, Buzzards Bay and Rhode Island).
